# <h3>Productivity_Tracker</h3>
-	Built a basic productivity tracker where the user can input his values for the number of hours spent on certain activities( like sleep, screen-time, hobbies, work, socialising and exercise) during the day throughout the week.
-	The progress report is displayed in the form of graphs, summarizing the weekâ€™s activity.
-	Libraries used-Flask,psycopg2, matplotlib, pandas,numpy and basic HTMl, CSS and bootstrap for front end. Postgres for database handling.
